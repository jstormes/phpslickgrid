# Welcome to PHPSlickGrid

## PHPSlickGrid provides server side support for using SlickGrid in PHP/Zend Framework 1.12

Find the outstanding SlickGrid component at [SlickGrid](https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid).

Some highlights:

* Lazy loading of data to the browser (only a small amount of data is kept browser side)
* Create grids quickly by reflecting MySQL tables to gird view
* Supports multi-column sort by passing the sort request back to MySQL
* Multi-user AJAX updates so all users see the same data near real time
* Zend 1.x integration
* Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) support
* Support for millions of rows

stuff.

Ideas:

1) Make grids consumable by MS-Office:
